# SPL-420 Meta-Protocol
SPL-420 is a new open-source, free & fair launch NFT standard made possible by LibrePlex Solscriptions. 

Anyone can deploy an SPL-420 NFT collection as long as they adhere to the protocol specifications below. These standards are in place so that the tokens are immediately tradable after mint on traditional Solana secondary marketplaces with our without inscription integration such as https://tensor.trade or https://magiceden.io

Additionally, anyone can mint an SPL-420 NFT on a **first is first** basis, only the first byte perfect image inscribed will be indexed in the official collection, don't mint duplicates or you'll be wasting your SOL!

**TOKEN MINTERS** if you are looking to mint a newly launched SPL-420 fair launch NFT follow these instructions:
- Go to the collections folder in this repo and find the folder of the collection you want to mint, it will contain all the files you need.
- Grab your favorite image from the "images" or "highres-offchain" folder & ensure it isn't already inscribed (LibrePlex will build a tool for this soon, for now it can be done manually by browsing inscriptions @ https://www.libreplex.io/inscriptions
- If it is not yet inscribed, use "https://solscribe.io" (recommended) or "https://biblio.tech/" or "https://sol-tools.tonyboyle.io/nft-tools/create-nft" to mint a new NFT with the following metadata parameters.
   - **Image:** Upload the unique image as the main NFT image. **THIS STEP IS MANDATORY**
   - **Name:** ```YOLOMIGOS #4268``` (Replace "4268" with the number exactly as it appears in the png file name from 0-4268). **MANDATORY**
   - SYMBOL: ```YOLO``` ***OPTIONAL***
   - **ROYALTIES:** Set to 0% **MANDATORY**
   - **CREATORS:** ```YoLoPJ4Vg7i3stQ77K5tyq7gd5hUsxcDjooaRV8LzbD``` (Use the provided creator address within the creator.txt file. Leave "shares" as default.) **MANDATORY** You cannot remove your address so add it as a second creator with 0% shares.
   - **MUTABILITY:** False / Off (Check advanced settings for this on Sol-Tools or toggle off for Biblio). **MANDATORY**
- Mint the NFT for 0.027 SOL (This is a MetaPlex fee. In the future we will transition to LibrePlex NFT standard which is free of protocol level fees like this).
- Head to https://www.libreplex.io/inscriptions to inscribe the SPL-420 NFT.
   - Click "Inscribe Yours" > "Use Wallet Contents" > "Fetch Mints" to load the NFTs in your wallet. On the SPL-420 NFT you just made click the button that says "Create Inscription".
   - Initialize the inscription account.
   - **IMPORTANT** If the project requries a low-res on-chain image, choose custom and upload the 1:1 pixel dimension version of the png file provided in the "inscribe-onchain" folder (matching the filename of the highres). Or if there is only an "images" folder, skip to the next step.
   - Click Resize to change the account size and rent will be charged depending on the file size of the image (no one receives this fee, it gets locked away forever). Be careful not to lock your SOL this way by inscribing the wrong image.
   - Click Inscribe to add the image data on chain.
   - Now that is complete and you can close the inscribe window. Click the magnifying glass. First ensure you see the image is being displayed properly on-chain. If it does you can set it to immutable!
   - If you did something wrong, go back to the upload and re-upload the png file, click update image, then resize, then inscribe again, then had back to the scanner to reclaim the rent. THEN you can make it immutable. Once you make it immutable you can never claim the rent back.
- That's it!

**PROJECT CREATORS** if you are creating an SPL-420 fair mint NFT collection follow these instructions:
- Create a new wallet to serve as the deploy wallet. Save the public address as creator.txt This will be used to index the collection. ```YoLoPJ4Vg7i3stQ77K5tyq7gd5hUsxcDjooaRV8LzbD```
- A master MCC NFT should be minted from this deploy wallet. Use "https://biblio.tech/" or "https://sol-tools.tonyboyle.io/nft-tools/create-nft". Ensure the royalties are set to 0% for the collection for maximum tradability (we recommend minting some supply as the project creators instead of setting royalties). Save the mint ID of this master NFT as collection.txt This will also be used to index the collection. ```BNtLxJevNQDk9sqxRN2Fvxq5yNPGZP1Ntow5m7snCMBu``` Choose an image that serves as the thumbnail for your collection on marketplaces.
- Make two copies of your NFT collection images, one at 1:1 pixel dimensions and one high res. Put the 1:1px image files inside a folder named "inscribe-onchain" and put the high res image files inside a folder name "highres-offchain". Or if your artwork is not a large file size you can just put a single copy of the collection inside a folder called "images".
- Fork this repo and create a pull request after adding a folder with your collection name and the following files inside. Collection names must be unique but there is no character limit. Do not change anything else aside from adding your folder or your PR will be rejected.
   - creator.txt
- Once the PR has been merged the information is made public and you can launch whenever you like by inscribing the deploy NFT at "https://www.libreplex.io/inscriptions" we suggest not deploying sooner than this step or someone may see it being inscribed and try to front run the mint.
   - Inscribe the MCC collection NFT https://www.libreplex.io/inscriptions by clicking "Inscribe Yours" > "Use Wallet Contents" > "Fetch Mints" to load the NFT in your wallet. On the MCC NFT click the button that says "Create Inscription".
   - Intialize the inscription account.
   - Inscribe your MCC NFT image or a low-res version at your discretion.
   - Resize the account to fit the low res file.
   - Inscribe the MCC image file!
   - Now that is complete and you can close the inscribe window. Click the magnifying glass on the inscription and set it to immutable. If you accidentally locked up too much rent you can reclaim it here, but only while it is mutable, once you make it immutable you can never claim back the rent.
- That's it! Your SPL-420 NFT collection is officially fair-launched and any solscriptions enjoyers can begin minting.
- Visit create.tensor.trade to submit your collection after you verify your hash list via the LibrePlex team!
